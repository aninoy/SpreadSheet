SpreadSheet
===========

An AngularJS Spreadsheet WebApp. The purpose of this app was to accomplish three things:
* Learn & build my first Angular App.
* Learn using Yeoman for scaffolding apps.
* Setup a Continuous Integration server using Jenkins to execute Grunt Builds based on Github web hooks to enable push notifications to Jenkins when any changes are pushed to the remote root repository.
* Automatically deploy Dist (or bin) subtree to the staging area for further manual testing.
